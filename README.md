# php_javascript_examples

Part of a much larger database application, which I developed as sole devloper at ProI Patent.
The full code consists of 44 classes and their corresponding controllers and views.
The code is just an example of my skills, altough other classes, not shared here, are more complex.
Code reviews of the full code can be given in person, if required to access my developer skills.

Since I worked at ProI Patent during this time, the code is their property.
It is not intended to share or edit.
