# php_javascript_examples

Part of a much larger database application, which I developed as sole devloper at ProI Patent 2015-2017.
The full code consists of 44 classes and their corresponding controllers and views.
The code is just an example of my skills, altough other classes and controllers, not shared here, are more complex.

Since I worked at ProI Patent during this time, the code is their property.
It is not intended to share or edit.
